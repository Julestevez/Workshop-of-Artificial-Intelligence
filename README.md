# Workshop of Artificial Intelligence

The project consists in two exercises to teach and practise Artificial Intelligence exercises, based on Scratch programming language. The two exercises are:
- K-means
- a simple neural network 

The upload exercises are the final answer of the exercise. The workshop is planned next way:

1) Give a short introduction of AI and the K-means and Neural Network algorithms
2) The students must fulfil some gaps of the code of the uploaded files. Each person can decide which piece of code to delete.
